# DonkieTown
## A low-cost experimental platform for research on Intelligent Vehicles. 

DonkieTown consists of one or more differential-drive robots called Asinus cars, a ground station, a localization system and a series of trusted techniques that easily allow the development of testbeds to implement and validate different strategies for collaborative autonomous driving, and study a variety of cases of study.

## Fast configuration.
In CIMAT-ZAC we use a router with a wireless local area network to avoid changing network configuration and ros environment variables for each computer whenever we need to relocate.
