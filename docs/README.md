# DonkieTown
## A low-cost experimental platform for research on Intelligent Vehicles. 

DonkieTown consists of one or more differential-drive robots called Asinus cars, a ground station, a localization system and a series of trusted techniques that easily allow the development of testbeds to implement and validate different strategies for collaborative autonomous driving, and study a variety of cases of study.

## TODO
- Create branch for upper camera
- Build scipy for jetson nano or develop kalman filter and linear_sum_assignment algos from scratch.
